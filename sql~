select  route_no,count(up) as trip from timings where up=1 group by route_no

SELECT route_no, max(serial_no) as bus_stop_count FROM BusRoutes group by route_no

select Schedule_Number, Count(Depot_Code) from DepotMapping  group by Schedule_Number 

Added a col count to depotmapping then perform a join on depot mapping and countfromdepotschedule
